# Clinch
Better than shooting for most people

## Posture
Try to engage / switch on the muscles and relax within your muscuskeletal structure, without flexing, arching or being tense `yoga posture`
1. Bring chin back
2. Engage scapula without raising traps
3. Pelvic tilt

## Head Position
- Avoid lazy wrestler posture: head up, hands up
- Throat line: apply pressure with hairline, spine straight
- Swimming drill; *dont give the inside position for free*
- If he goes low you go low

## Stance
- More weight on the front part of the feet
- Find optimum stance for stability

## Hand Fighting
- Elbows connected to the front of the body (T-Rex)
- Grip soft to create moments of control
- Release his grip ASAP: hold with one hand and pull against the thumb

### Snapdown: abrupt, whipping pop

## Standing Him Up
- If he has a superior skill set or trying to shoot
- Get inside and stand him up
- Try to pummel in at the same time
- Don't stand up without being sure they come up with you

## Pop & Go
- The moment he gets a single collar tie, simultaneously:
- Pop his elbow with your cross hand
- Level change down and go inside, then come back up
- Grab the seatbelt / underhook and fight for the head position
- Always finish with hairline to neckline, otherwise you gained nothing
- Seal: lose the distance between the hips and walk into him

### Attacking Base
- Seal first - overtake his base to disrupt his balance

### The Single Underhook
- Hand is coming up to grab his joint w/ false grip
- Lock in: elbow pulls and comes down to torso, and creates tension
- Otherwise, he can lock your arm down
- Then, hold the other arm by the elbow and `body lock`

### Head and Arm Pinch Lock
- Get an S-grip behind his head, with the back arm over the other
- Get your hips away from his
- Tilt him: one arm up and the other down

## The Russian
- If his single collar tie's elbow is inside
- Maintain forward pressure and spinal alignment
- Raise your traps, turn your shoulder, and move in
- Grab bicep and wrist (thumb towards him)
- Pressure behindhis shoulder with the anterior part of your shoulder
### Threaded 2-on-1
- As he pulls his arm give it to him
- Punch the other arm through his armpit, below your forearm and above his forearm
- Pull him to the ground
